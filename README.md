An Online Scholarship Portal is an online platform where student can fill their
details in an application on the go and also searches for scholarships to apply easily.

At Admin page one can upload the scholarship details available to apply given by the
donor organisations so that they can work upon the suggestions and improvement can
be done on the project, also they can upload scholarship awardee details. Usually, the
user will be asked to select scholarship as per the eligibility required, and the same is
recorded in the database. A notification is sent to the user as soon as the record is
being saved.
